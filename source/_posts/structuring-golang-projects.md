# Structuring Golang Projects

<img src="/images/structure.png" alt="prs" style="width:400px;"/>

Who never ask yourself about what is the best way to create a new project? Should I use the Hexagonal, DDD, Clean and these others fancy architectures? Go has a different style, but when you are a newcomer in the language, probably you don't had the enough time to consume and read all the good repositories and resources to drive your decisions. This post is a collection of my thoughts and experiences about how to structure Go projects. With name conventions, package organization, and some tips to make your codebase more readable and maintainable.

# Dilemmas

<img src="/images/structure1.png" alt="prs" style="width:200px;"/>


- Should I put everything together?
- Start small and grow?
- What is the "Go way"?


# What is non-negotiable?

- Consistency across the codebase
- Easy to change, loosely coupled
- Easy to test, that implies decoupled package with clear duties and goals
- Design reflect how the software works

## Grouping

Pros and Cons of each approach and my final decision(Yep, I have my favorite one üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

All examples will turn around an application that implements a file system, that implements an in-memory file system and a file system that uses the disk.

The entities that this file system will deal with are:

- Lamps
- Processes

And these operations will serve an HTTP API.

Above the structure of each approach and a brief explanation of each one.
